It looks like the baseball itself has changed a lot throughout history, I wonder what the complete evolution of the game itself has been affected by that. Izahbel 

How does the MLB know if a bat is illegal? Like you mentioned they can have a lighter material inside but how do they find out? Owen 

I like how you explained the history of baseball bats and explained how they have evolved over the years. You mentioned the Torpedo bats that the yankees used, didn't they mention that they would ban them? Jaxon 

Superb organization! Each paragraph followed from the previous one, matched the sub-head, and gave just the right about of information.  Words were all well chosen, sentences all complete. Nice work!

The only rough spot was the "Famous Equipment Cheats" - that came out of the blue.  It would be better to have a paragraph where you talk about how little modifications to sports equipment can make a big difference, and therefore create scandals.  Then you can include corking as the first bullet, followed by deflategate and pine tar bullets.  Mr. Moreinis
